    <h2> About Me: </h2>
    <p>My name is Charles, and this is a little about me. Im currently a 27 year old MIE (Manufacturing and Industrial Engineer) for Amazon Prime Air, but I have an extreme love for vehicle aftermarket electronics. Im an experinced and certified Advanced MECP certified technician and have five years of experince working on installing electronics in cars. I have a passion for always trying to help improve others experience and decided why not impact where people spend a majority of there time in cars. I created this website to help me better develop my skills i the trade, as well as give people the oppertunity to see what possible solutions they may be missing out on.</p>

    <h3>My SDE Journey</h3>
    <p>As I continue to journey into Web Development I had such a cool experience so far.</p>
    <p>Its been really neat being able to create web pages and see how to breakdown the way HTML is able to translate what is being commanded into such cool formats and ideas. Im really excited to see what the future holds with everything else we will be putting together. </p>
